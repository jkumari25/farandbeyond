                for preparing Personal Data in the interest of the Data Controller. FARANDBEYOND, as a Data Controller and
                Data Processor, is answerable for guaranteeing consistence with the Data Protection necessities illustrated
                in this arrangement.

                and expects all FarandBeyond Employees and Third Parties to share in this commitment. Any breach of
